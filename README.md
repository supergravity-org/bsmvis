## Under Development

python scripts and models for building a complete and partial models of:

| type of object | FP | simplified |
| prism | x | |
| proton | X | X |
| electron/(positron) | X | X |
| cosmic lattice | X | X |

Those are constructed in blender and can later be exported.

## Requirements

* blender with python bindings

## Usage

In blender open text editor and load wanted file like: create_prism.py
Execute the script. You can edit the modules and just re-execute the script
without reloading.
